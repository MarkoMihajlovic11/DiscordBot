# Discord Bot: Price Scraper

This Discord bot allows users to check the current prices of items on g2g.com by using the commands !price or !rate. The bot will scrape g2g.com for the lowest available price and send the user a private message containing the price, discounted by 25%.

Additionally, the bot will react to messages in the Discord server based on the wow server name. If the wow server name contains the word "price" or "rate", the bot will react with a "✅" emoji. If not, the bot will react with a "❌" emoji.


## Setup

You will need to populate "token.txt" file with the bot token
